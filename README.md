I really love this quote from the man himself because I really love making ideas real. Look at my repos, UI-wise it's all the same looking because I really love the frosted glass design and consistency. Which I cannot find during my first days in linux, that's why I created/designed them. I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it and I was really I was alive.
